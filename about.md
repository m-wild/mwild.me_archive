Hi! I'm Michael Wildman. I'm a Software Engineer and drummer living in Auckland New Zealand. I have a passion for technology and I love building software that people love to use. 

I have worked for [The University of Auckland](http://auckland.ac.nz/) developing a Desktop Single Sign-On solution.
I was a national finalist in the [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://www.imaginecup.com/) 2014 for my idea of a website where students can work together on past tests and exams.

I am currently working for [M2 Group NZ](http://m2group.co.nz)

You can find some of my work at [github.com/tehmantra](https://github.com/tehmantra).

And my band at [massesnz.com](https://massesnz.com/).
