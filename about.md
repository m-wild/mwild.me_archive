Hi! I'm Michael Wildman. I'm a programmer, web developer, and drummer living in Auckland New Zealand. I have a passion for technology and I love building software that people love to use. 

I have worked for [The University of Auckland](http://auckland.ac.nz/) developing a Desktop Single Sign-On solution, integrating uApprove into Shibboleth, and prototyping a solution for synching data between Oracle SQL and Microsoft Active Directory.

I was a national finalist in the [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://www.imaginecup.com/) 2014 for my idea of a website where students can work together on past tests and exams. In my experience, students worked better when no answers were given to them. They were forced to work together to find the right answers, and this website was designed to foster that collaboration. A prototype version is live at [examinate.co.nz](http://examinate.co.nz/).

You can find some of my work at [github.com/tehmantra](http://github.com/tehmantra/).

And my band at [massesnz.com](http://massesnz.com/).

I'm currently looking for work and can be contacted at [michael@mwild.me](mailto:michael@mwild.me).
