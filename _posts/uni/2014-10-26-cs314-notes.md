##Electrical signals
- Electrical potential is _Voltage_ (_V_)
- Electrical flow is _Current_ -- measured in _Amps_ (_A_)
- To perform _work_ we need both current and voltage
- The amount of energy that can be transferred between systems per second is known as _Power_ and is measured in _Watts_ (_W_).
- Power is proportional to the square of the voltage.

####Types of cables
- Coax
	- inner copper conductor w/ plastic or foam insulator
	- copper mesh / tinfoil to lower signal radiation and interference
	- ratio of diameters -> impedance
	- larger diameter -> less signal loss over distance
- Twisted pair
	- each complementary pair is twisted to reduce signal radiation
- Optical fibre
	- outer core has a lower _refractive index_ than inner. this means light in the inner core is "trapped" by reflection/refraction
	- _multimode_ fibre sends more than one signal by using different angles of incidence
	- _wavelength multiplexing_ sends more signal by using different color light
    - light travels at _2*10^8 m/s_ through fibre (== __200Km in 1ms__)

####Wireless
- received signal power drops to a quarter when the distance doubles
- received signal voltage drops to a half when distance doubles (power is proportional to square of voltage)
- can typically live with received power that is _10^11_ times smaller than transmitted
- if the cycle time is _T_, then a radio wave travels the distance _λ = cT_ in the time it completes one cycle. (_λ_ = wavelength)
- _f = 1/T_ is called the _frequency_ of the signal

##Logarithm rules
1.	log is the inverse exponential:	if _x = y^z_, then _log_y x = z_
2.	convert log bases by diving by the base you want: _log-10 x = ln x / ln 10_
3.	- Products turn into sums under log functions: _log_y(AB) = log_y A + log_y B_
	- Ratios turn into differences: _log_y(A/B) = log_y A - log_y B_
	- Exponents turn into factors: _log_y(A^b) = b log_y A_



##Ratios and Decibels
- For two __voltages__: _r(dB) = 20 log_10(V_1/V_2)_
- For two __powers__: _r(dB) = 10 log_10(P_1/P_2)_

Power ratio  | dB 
-----------: | ---:
1:1 | 0
2:1 | 3
4:1 | 6
8:1 | 9
16:1 | 12
10:1 | 10
100:1 | 20
1000:1 | 30
10000:1 | 40

- with _10^4_ the exponent is _4_ which gives _40dB_
- __multiplying power ratios = adding dB__
	- _10:1 * 10:1 = 100:1_
	- _10dB + 10dB = 20dB_


- _20:1_ break it up (with products) _20 = 10*2_
	then use the __sum__ of _10:1_ and _2:1_ in dB, _20:1 = 13dB_
- _44dB_ break it up (with sums) _44 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 - 3 - 3_
	addition of dB -> multiplication of power ratio
	subtraction of dB -> division of power ratio
	_100000 / 4 = 25000_	
- If we have a prime number ratio, __one we cant break up__ then remember: accuracy is important on the dB side, not so important on the power ratio side. (So we can round the ratio side)
- We can use decibels to quote powers by comparing to 1 watt (dBW) or 1 milliwatt (dBm).
	- _30dBm = 30dB + 1mW = 1000 * 1mW = 1W_
	- _-90dBW = -90dB + 1W = 10^-9 W_


##Satellite communication
- _Geostationary_ (or geosynchronous) satellites orbit on the equatorial plane at ~35,000km
	- They orbit the earth once every siderial day and thus appear to be in the same spot in the sky for 24hrs a day -- easy to point a dish antenna at
- _Low/Medium-Earth-Orbit_ (LEO/MEO) satellites orbit on some other plane and are much closer to the surface
	- they will cover more territory but will move out of sync with the earth and >1 is needed to maintain a link
	- the antenna on earth requires some movement to point to the satellite

##Types of communication channel
- _One-to-one_, __Simplex__ 
	- receiver doesn't communicate back to transmitter
	- e.g. TV remote control
- _One-to-one_, __Full-Duplex__ 
	- both parties can transmit and receive simultaneously
	- e.g. phone line
- _One-to-one_, __Half-duplex__
	- only one party can transmit at any one time
	- e.g. walkie-talkie radios
- _One-to-many_, Simplex __broadcast channel__
	- e.g. TV, radio
- _One-to-one_, __shared channel__
	- one party communicating with several others, one at a time
	- e.g. GSM cellphones
	- Special case: _wiretap channel_ (other party(s) listen in)
- __Many-to-many__, shared channel
	- participants act as both transmitters and receivers
	- easy to implement
	- only one transmitter can access the channel at a time
		- participants must negotiate channel access, manage collisions, or stick to a timing scheme
	- not every receiver may be able to hear every transmitter
	- e.g. CB radio, 802.11 WiFi
- Each channel has advantages and disadvantages and is suited to specific solutions
- Channel division methods
	- Lay separate cables or fibres
	- separate by mode or color (fibre)
	- separate by frequency (radio and electrical cable)
	- separate geographically (radio)
	- separate by polarization (radio)
	- separate by time slot (all media)

##Signals and information
- The __frequency__ is the number of oscillation cycles per second, measured in hertz (_Hz_)
- The __amplitude__ is the 'height' of the signal (voltage), typically measured in volts (_V_)
- The __power__ is always proportional to the square of a voltage, it's measured in watts (_W_)
- The __phase__ of a sine wave is a measure for how much the waveform is shifted to the left or right (i.e. along the time axis). It's and angle, so it's typically measured in degrees or radians

####Fourier transforms / series
- All signals can be looked at in two ways:
	- voltage over time
	- a mix of sinusoidal frequency signals, this is known as a _Fourier series_
- Fourier analysis shows us that to get a _square wave_ (as those used in a computer bit: 0 or 1) we would need an infinite number of sine functions with an infinitely high frequencies. This is not possible in reality.
- Transition time between bits limits the number of bits we can send per unit time.
	- The faster we can transition, the more bits we can send.
	- The more frequencies we can include, the more bits per second we can send.
- The __bandwidth__ of a communication channel is the difference between the highest and lowest frequency it can carry -- the __frequency band__ in which the communication takes place.
- bandwidth _~=_ (potential) bit rate
- if the lowest frequency in our band is 0Hz, we call the signal in the band the _baseband signal_. (a simple bit stream with low/high voltage for 0/1 bits is always a baseband signal)

####Power spectrum
- We can look at signal not just in the time domain (horizontal axis is time), but also in the _frequency domain_
	- In the frequency domain, the horizontal axis is power, i.e., the squares of amplitudes of the sinewaves in the signal
	- This is called the _power spectrum_ of the signal
- The difference between the highest and lowest (significant) frequency component in a signal's power spectrum represents the signal's bandwidth.
- In communications, the term bandwidth is used to describe both the width of the frequency band available for a signal and the width of a signal's actual power spectrum. (which we mean should be apparent from the context).

####Modulation
- Shaping an analog signal waveform in order to transmit information
- __Amplitude Modulation__ (AM) 
 	- causes sidebands at _fc - fm_ and _fc + fm_; total bandwidth is _2*fm_
 	- robust against fading
 	- amplitude shift keying (ASK) in discrete case
- __Frequency Modulation__ (FM)
	- more robust as we always transmit the carrier at full power
	- usually take more bandwidth
	- frequency shift keying (FSK)
- __Phase Modulation__ (PM)
	- vary the phase of the carrier signal, very similar to FM in many respects
- By combining AM and PM with constant frequency we get a 2 dimensional state. __constellation__
- binary PSK (only change the phase)
- Quaternary PSK (BPSK) represents 4 states or 2 bits
- 16-QAM (16 states or 4 bits) each neighbouring constellation differs by exactly 1 bit (_Gray code_), if we decode a neighbour then we only get 1 incorrect bit
- 16-QAM is not the limit (i.e. 16X16 in 65536-QAM) used in ADSL, radio, and optical.
- Symbols (constellation points) per second is _Baud rate_ (different to bit rate)
- distance between points determines robustness

####Signal degradation
- Amplitude loss through __spreading__ and __attenuation__ in the medium it propagates in.
- _Distorted_ by Fourier components being attenuated different amounts
- _Corrupted_ by _noise_ (flat (white) or shaped) _W/Hz_
	- the effect of noise is a factor of the noise power (level) (diameter of the cloud) and the signal level (distance to nearest neighbour in constellation)
	- SNR (_signal-to-noise ratio_) determines how close detected signal points come to other constellation points. Can be used to estimate bit error (higher SNR, fewer errors)
	- _log_2(S/N)_ gives bits per symbol
- Shannon-Hartley capacity theorem
	- _C = B * log_2(S/N)_
	- capacity = bandwidth * log_2 (signal / noise)
	- fundamental limit on speed with a given bandwidth (though usually lower in reality)

##Error recovery
- Do nothing: use/output incorrect data
- Error detection: may substitute with defaults or ask for retransmission
- Error correction: use data to reconstruct the original transmission
- __Parity bits__ - an extra bit on each payload so that when added the sum of all bits is even (or odd, depending on implementation)
- __Network coding__ sends linear combinations of multiple messages; the receiver recovers th original message by solving the system of linear equations

####Checksums
- often CRC or __digests__ (more complex to protect against intentional interference)
- CRCs use _modulo-2_ arithmetic
- eg. divide 100110110000 by 11001 modulo-2

```
 100110110000 : 11001 = 11100110 (result: NOT interesting)
-11001
 =10100
 -11001
  =11011
  -11001
   =00101
   -00000 (use 00000 when the result starts with a 0 at each step)
    =01010
    -00000
     =10100
     -11001
      =11010
      -11001
       =00110
        =0110 (remainder: interesting)
```
- if we want to send the message `10011011` then we would pick a _generator polynomial G_ `11001` and then add _n_ 0's to our message `100110110000`
- now we divide `100110110000` by _G_
- we then take the remainder `0110` and replace the 0's we added so the transmitted message is `100110110110`
- when the receiver divides `100110110110` by _G_ they will get a remainder of 0
- if the receiver gets a _non-zero_ remainder then the message has errors!


####Hamming codes
- use multiple parity bits, send 8 bit message with additional 4 parity bits (12bits)
- each parity bit checks multiple bits
- we recompute parity bits at the receiver and if they are the same then we (likely) have no error

```
p1 p2 m1 p3 m2 m3 m4 p4 m5 m6 m7 m8

p1 : m1 m2    m4 m5    m7
p2 : m1    m3 m4    m6 m7
p3 :    m2 m3 m4          m8
p4 :             m5 m6 m7 m8

```

##Coding
- _Encode_ information for transmission, adapt information to the channel alphabet
	- some channels may not map easily to binary (eg. 3 states)
	- we can map higher-order alphabets to binary using ASCII, Unicode, etc

####Clocking
- the receiver need to know when symbols begin and end, as well as when to take samples
- if the receiver and transmitter's clocks are out of sync the receiver will miss bits and/or receive bits multiple times
- we can add additional clock information to the signal
- __NRZI__ (non-return to zero inverted) with bit stuffing
	- code a `1` as "no change in level" and a `0` as a transition from the current level to opposite
      
    ```
    ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' 
    ‾‾|_______|‾‾‾|___|‾‾‾
    1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 
    ```
	- however if there are too many consecutive 1's then we may still have clocking problems so we use __bit stuffing__
		- Insert a `0` after every 5th consecutive `1`
		- `01101111111111011` turns into `011011111 0 11111 0 011`
		- receiver removes these bits -- easy to implement in hardware
- __Manchester coding__ codes `0` as transition from high to low and `1` from low to high

```
'   '   '   '   '   '   '   '   '   '   '
|___|‾‾‾|_|‾|_|‾|___|‾‾‾|___|‾‾‾|___|‾‾‾|__
0   1   0   0   0   1   0   1   0   1   0 
```
	- this means the signal rate is twice the data-rate, not very bandwidth friendly
- __Differential manchester coding__ codes `0` as transition from opposite level to current level and `1` as transition from current to opposite

```
'   '   '   '   '   '   '   '   '   '   '
|_|‾|___|‾‾‾|___|‾|_|‾‾‾|_|‾|___|‾|_|‾‾‾|__
1   0   1   1   1   0   1   0   1   0   1 
```

####Framing
- It's common for a channel to be idle, so we need to know when communications starts and stops
- one approach (Ethernet) is to start a frame with `01111110`, i.e., 6 1's (the most we can get otherwise with bit stuffing is 5) then we protect every frame with a 4 byte CRC and a closing `01111110`

####Compression
- using variable length codes
- must be _uniquely decipherable_ i.e. no codeword is a prefix of another
- __Huffman codes__
	1. sort the probabilities of the letters you wish to encode
	2. combine the two lowest probabilities and sort again
		- repeat until only 1 probability is left
	3. this gives a tree
	4. assign codewords to the tree, level by level, starting from the root with an empty bit string
	5. at each branching (combined probability), add a 0 to the bit string on the left and a 1 for the right branch
	6. the strings assigned to nodes at the bottom are codewords 

####Analog-to-Digital Conversion
- ADC samples on _voltage ramps_ at _discrete intervals_, meaning that between the intervals we have no way of knowing what the voltage was
- voltage ramps take time, 16-bit ADC needs to ramp through 65536 voltage values
- the receiver is often the human eye/ear, by leaving out insignificant information we can get the message across in fewer bits (_lossy compression_)

##UDP, TCP, and other Transport protocols
####UDP
- IP is an unreliable __datagram__ protocol
- UDP simply uses IP to transport packets, It does nothing prevent out-of-order packets or data loss.
- UDP header:

```
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          Source Port          |        Destination Port       |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|             Length            |           Checksum            |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                   data                                    ... 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

```

- Port numbers used to find destination (source port is optional)
- Length in bytes of UDP header + data (should be less than MTU)
- 16bit checksum
- If a packet is lost UDP does nothing to recover it, applications must include their own timeouts and error recovery
- Used by __RTP__ (Real-time Transport Protocol)
	- provides payload-type identification, sequence numbering, timestamp for synchronisation, delivery motoring
	- but with the _unreliability_ of UDP (codecs must allow for this)

####TCP
- IP is an __unreliable__ datagram protocol
- TCP intends to fix the inherent problems of IP
- Flow control
	- Rate control: sender determines the maximum safe sending rate and never exceeds it
	- Sliding window: sender sends up to a 'window' full of data and pauses for acknowledgement
		- window size is dynamically adjusted
		- missing acknowledgement causes retransmission
- TCP uses _sliding window_
	- Initially with a small window size, but will increase window size as data flow accelerates
	- This works well over an enormous range of speeds
	- Works well as router load approaches 100%
	- Retransmission fits naturally
- TCP connection phases
	- Establishment
	- Data transfer
	- Disconnection
- Listener has to be willing to accept incoming connections, listens on a specific port

```

DISCONNECTION:

```

- _Port numbers_ - used to find TCBs (transmission control blocks) at each end
- _Sequence number_ - number of the first byte in this TCP segment
- _Acknowledgement number_ - next sequence the sender is expecting
- _ACK_ - the ACK number is valid for this packet
- _RST_ - reset (emergency disconnect)
- _SYN_ - synchronise sequence numbers
- _FIN_ - finished (normal disconnect)
- _Window_ - the payload data
- _Checksum_ - a 16bit 1's complement of the 1's complement sum
- after the initial SYN/ACK both ends know the initial sequence number and initial window size
- both ends may send up to the window size (if SND.NXT >= SND.UNA + SND.WND, wait)
- if ACK does not arrive within a certain (_dynamic_) timeout, the packet is retransmitted (a good timeout is 2x RTT (round-trip time))
- TCP is a _greedy_ protocol - it will pump as much data as the path will take
	- modern TCP uses things like slow start, limiting retransmission, fast recovery to avoid congestion
	- routers keep an eye out for greedy _cheats_ and discard their packets

```

- __TLS__ (transport layer security) or the older SSL _protects TCP sessions_
	- uses a handshake procedure to negotiate crypto algorithm
	- server's _public key_ is signed by a _CA public key_


##Flow/Link
- Transmission can be _asynchronous_ (start/stop at any time), _synchronous_ (use a continuous clock), or _isochronous_
- __Multiplexing__ (Mux) puts several bitstreams on one channel
	- _Time-division multiplexing_ (TDM) each stream has a slot, if it has nothing to send then its slot is wasted
	- _Statistical multiplexing_ similar to TDM but weighted on how much data a channel has to send, if a channel has nothing to send another can use its slot
	- RF can send each stream as _modulation_
	- optical can use different _wavelengths_

####Flow control
- __Signalling__ - the receiver tells the sender when it's ready to receive
- __Frame-orientated control__ breaks large sequences into smaller frames, _flow control_ defines how frames are sent, tracked and controlled
- __Stop-and-Wait__ simply send a frame and wait for ACK/NAK, if NAK send farm again
- However this means _>50%_ of the time is wasted waiting for ACKs
- __Sliding window__ allows us to have up to _i_ (window size) frames on the wire at any time
	- __Selective repeat__ allows any frame to ACKed by its sequence number, out of sequence frames are _buffered_ until earlier frames have been ACKed
	- Sliding window is up to _99%_ efficient (smaller frames are less efficient)
- The _Bandwidth-Delay Product_ for a link is the data rate x the link delay
	- e.g. Auckland-Hamilton @ 10Mb/s = _10Mb/s * 0.6ms = 6000bits_ (750B)
	- buffers should be _at least double this_ so that the transport protocol can keep the link busy

##LAN
- Layer __1__ _physical_ (signalling + modulation), layer __2__ _link_ (hosts talk w/ frames), layer __3__ _network_ (pass packets between LANs e.g. IP)
- LAN is layer 2, its _standardised_ (802.x) to allow hardware from different manufacturers to communicate
- Divided into two sublayers __LLC__ (logical link control - very complex but flexible) and __MAC__ (medium access control)
- _MAC_ manages the physical layer so that 2 senders don't talk at once
- _Aloha protocol_ - any host can broadcast a message to central (Menehune) at any time, if it is received correctly it will be ACKed (on a different frequency). If two clash then neither will be ACKed so they will wait (a random time) then retransmit. (Simple but inefficient protocol)
- __CSMA__ _Carrier Sense Multiple Access_ - listen to the medium for activity and only transmit if there is none. Can also use slot time + random choice to reduce collisions.
- __CSMA/CD__ - includes additional collision detection. When a collision is detected, stop transmitting and send _jam_ signal
- _HDLC_ (High-level Data Link Control) was used before modern LAN, sometimes still used when a simple serial connection is needed. Uses bit stuffing, and frames similar to Ethernet.

####Ethernet
- CSMA/CD on a shared _bus_ cable. Transceiver implements the MAC functions.
- Sender builds a frame, sends it to NIC (network interface card). NIC adds an ethernet header, waits for idle then sends. Transceiver watches for collision and tells NIC success/fail. NIC uses an _exponential backoff_ algorithm. Receiving NIC checks CRC, if it was for this host (or group) then sends it to host via interrupt handler
- Ethernet addresses are __MAC-48__, 6-byte UID (3 byte OUI (manufacturer), 3 byte NIC specific), bit7 = unicast/multicast, bit8 = GUID/local UID
- the data length field is widely used as an _Ethertype_ field to save bits
- _Maximum frame size_ stops a host from monopolising the medium, _minimum frame size_ allows for headers etc
- __10Mb/s Coax Ethernet__
	- Manchester encoding
	- __collision domain__ - max segment length _500m_, max of _four_ repeaters joining 5 segments
	- Collision signal will take _T_ time to come back. Worst case _T = 50us_ @ 10Mb/s = _500b_, minimum frame size is therefore _512b_ (64B)
- __100Mb/s UTP (twisted pair)__
	- to much noise for Manchester encoding directly, so use 4B/5B block encoding but still too noisy for NRZI
	- __MLT-3__ signalling (3 cycling states, `1` cycle to next state, `0` maintain current state)
	- the frame is transmitted in 1/10th the time so the max segment length is 100m
- __100Mb/s on fibre__ - uses 4B/5B encoding with NRZI
- __Gigabit Ethernet__ - uses a longer _minimum frame size_ (4096b) to keep its 100m segment length
	
####WiFi 802.11(a,b,g,n,ac...)
- Uses low power 5GHz & 2.4GHz (unregulated spectrum)
- __Spread spectrum wireless__ uses _Frequency Hopping_ (FHSS - uses a set of channels, hop in a pseudo random sequence (79 channels, 22 sequences)) and _Direct-Sequence_ (DSSS - for each bit oxr with a chip sequence corresponding to a channel)
- 802.11 works by collision _avoidance_ as a cheap radio can't detect collisions (it's own signal drowns incoming signal)
- __CSMA/CA__ - wait until the channel is empty then send a brief "I'm coming" signal and transmit if the channel stays empty
- Each AP (access point) can't necessarily hear each other AP - so they can't reliably detect a collision
- __CTS/RTS__ - send an RTS to a station, the station will reply with a CTS it is not transmitting or receiving or received another RTS at the same time.
- _Infrastructure mode_ (one AP as a control point) or _Ad hoc_ (direct user to user (operational nightmare))
- APs can _relay_ packets to another AP (via Ethernet or WiFi). The sender could even move to another AP and keep communicating with its target
- Uses _Service Set ID_ (SSID) to determine which APs are part of a _Basic Service Set_ (BSS)
- 802.11 frame has 4 address fields to allow for AP relaying (Destination Address (DA), Source Address (SA), Sending Wireless AP address, Receiving Wireless AP address)
- __Security__
	- __WEP__ (wired equivalent privacy) 40-bit key (easy to crack)
	- __WPA__ a quick fix for WEP
	- __WPA2__ secure based on _AES_ encryption
	- Web based authorization offers _no_ security to WiFi user

####Bridges and switches
- __Repeaters__ simply _reshapes_ (regenerates), amplifies and sends on the signal
- __Hubs__ are _multiport repeaters_ (however, also a general word for more complex switches and routers)
	- these are essential cable extenders (+nothing to config, +cheap, -don't split collision domain)
- __Bridges__ allow us to send packets beyond the collision domain by _reading_ the packet off one Ethernet and then _send_ it on the other _independently_
	- pretends to be the destination on network 1 and the source on network 2
	- the bridge must know where each Ethernet station is, and only send packets in that direction
	- the bridge will build its switching table from source addresses
	- bridges must communicate with each other to avoid loops
		- build a _spanning tree_ -- does _not_ optimize paths
	- +self configuring, +cheap, +overcome distance limit (regeneration), -don't cure saturation, -notorious for 'broadcast storms' -hard to manage large network
- __Switches__ behave like _multiport bridges_
	- ideally full duplex at line speed on every port
	- +self config, +reliable, +regeneration, +avoid saturation, +suit fiber cabling, -require systematic design and cable management
- __VLANs__ (virtual LANs) can emulate 2+ separate Ethernets on one physical infrastructure (send extra bytes defining which LAN you're on and only receive from that LAN)

####Routing algorithms and protocols
- Represent the network as a graph, built by exchanging 
- Real world network is massive and constantly changing -- algorithms must be scalable, dynamic and distributed
- End-systems offload routing to their default router
- __Distance vector routing__: router informs neighbors of its _best paths_, each router calculates best paths for itself based on its neighbors best paths
	- router computes its 'distance' (number of hops) to each other router in the same network
	- _Bellman-Ford algorithm_ (allows negative weighted edges, minimize the path to x for every path through x)
	- -sending tables doesn't scale, -slow to converge after change, -can lead to loops
- __Link state routing__: router exchanges _link status info_ with its neighbors, each router relies on accuracy of its neighbors status info in calculating best paths through the whole map
	- _Dijkstra algorithm_ (no negative weights, minimize path to x only once)
	- +algorithm is quicker, +receives link states so it doesn't have to start at 0, -have to trust your neighbor is correct
- IGP: _Interior_ gateway protocol, within an organization or ISP
	- __RIP__ (routing information protocol), the original DV protocol
		- uses 16 == infinity to keep graph manageable
		- each router sends its DV table: on startup, every 30 sec, on change, on request
		- -quite noisy, with many unused bits, -long convergence time, -bad for large networks
	- __OSPF__ (open shortest path first), common internet LS protocol
		- distributed Dijkstra algorithm
		- distinguishes routers from networks
		- neighbors can request link state database
		- possible to split a large AS (autonomous system) into separate 'areas'
		- LSA (link state announcement) is updated as soon as there is any change in the network, and on a timer
- EGP: _Exterior gateway protocol, interconnect sties and ISPs (inter-domain routing)
	- __BGP4__ (Border gateway protocol 4) the only EGP in use today
	- Modified DV protocol
	- maps routing between autonomous systems
	- each AS is given an AS#, a an AS path is a list of AS# that lead to a given destination
	- messages: open, update, notification (intentionally close), keepalive (n.b. no request message)
	- update: origin, AS path, IP of next hop, unreachable (if path failure), metric (within an AS, BGP doe not weight links), community -- routing policies as opposed to weights (i.e. _avoid AS5168_ US DoD)
	- uses Bellman-Ford with _AS path length_ as metric (path vector)
	- BGP _aggregates_ adjacent prefixes in a binary tree to keep the table manageable

##Application layer
- __Server__ -- always-on host, static IP, data center for scaling
- __Clients__ -- communicate with server, intermittent connection, dynamic IP, no inter-communication
- __P2P__ -- _no_ server, arbitrary end systems directly communicate, intermittent connection, peers get and supply service from/to other peers
	- __self scalability__: new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
- applications send/receive data to/from __sockets__ -- interface with the OS, addressed by IP:PORT (OS handles transport/network/link layers)
- application-layer __protocols__ define: _types_ of messages exchanged, message _syntax_, message _semmantics_, and _rules_ for how/when to send/respond to messages
- _transport layer services_ required by applications include _data integrity_ (TCP vs UDP), _timing_ _throughput_, _security_ (SSL encrypts TCP connections)

###HTTP
- TCP port 80
- stateless -- server maintains no information about past client requests
- __non-persistent HTTP__: at most 1 object then close connection -- multiple objects require multiple connections
	- __RTT__: time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
	- non-persistent HTTP requires _2*RTT + file transmission time_
- __persistent HTTP__: multiple objects sent over the single TCP connection
	- as little as one _RTT_ for all referenced objects
- HTTP request:

```
METHOD request_url HTTP/1.1\r\n
HEADER1: VALUE\r\n
HEADER2: VALUE\r\n
HEADERn: VALUE\r\n

```

- HTTP methods
	- GET, POST
	- HEAD (only headers)
	- PUT (upload file to url)
	- DELETE (delete file at the url)
- HTTP response

- HTTP status codes:
	- 1xx -- informational
	- 2xx -- successful e.g. 200 OK
	- 3xx -- redirection e.g. 301 Moved Permanently
	- 4xx -- client error e.g. 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found
	- 5xx -- server error e.g. 505 HTTP Version Not Supported
- __Cookies__ allow us to maintain a user-server _state_
	- server response includes `Set-Cookie: name=value\r\n` header
	- client will store the cookie locally
	- subsequent client requests will use the `Cookie: name=value\r\n` header
	- usually the cookie will be a key that the server will use in a database
- __Web caches__ (proxy server) can be used reduce response time for client requests, reduce network traffic, effectively deliver content
	- a caching server on a private LAN can be much _cheaper_ and more effective than upgrading he external access link (to internet)
	- cache will send request to the origin server with `If-Modified-Since: DATETIME\r\n`
	- origin server will respond with `HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\r\n` and _no payload_ if the requested object has not been modified, or `HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n` and send the object if it has been modified

###FTP
- File transfer protocol
- TCP port 21
- client can browse the remote directory, then send a request for a file
- the _server_ opens a 2nd TCP connection to send the file
- the control connection is _out of band_ (i.e. it is a separate connection), the server maintains _state_ (current directory, authentication)
- commands (sent as ASCII over the control channel) include:
	- `USER username`
	- `PASS password`
	- `LIST` file listing of cd
	- `RETR filename` retrieve (get) the file
	- `STOR filename` store (put) the file
- return codes follow HTTP convention

###Email
- __SMTP__ (simple mail transfer protocol)
	- TCP port 25
	- _direct transfer_ server-to-server
	- ASCII commands and HTTP-like response codes
	- messages must be in 7-bit ASCII
	- end-users use a user agent (UA) to connect to the mail server to send and receive mail

```

- __POP__ (post office protocol) -- stateless, authorization, download, delete or save server copy
- __IMAP__ (internet mail access protocol) -- keeps user state, additional features over POP including manipulation of stored messages on the server
- __HTTP__ clients such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail

###DNS
- Domain Name System -- maps a human readable name (e.g. mwild.me) to an IP address (e.g. 103.245.222.133)
- _distributed database_ implemented in a hierarchy of many _name servers_ (enables scalability)
- e.g. for www.amazon.com
	- query root DNS to find the 'com' DNS server
	- query .com DNS server to get amazon.com DNS server
	- query amazon.com DNS server to get IP for www.amazon.com
- __Local DNS__ name server -- does not strictly belong to the hierarchy
	- each ISP (and large organization) has one
	- acts as a caching proxy for DNS records
- __Iterated query__ the machine itself will do all the name resolution required, the DNS server it contracts will only send back what information it knows. (e.g. you contact your local DNS server and _it will do the iterative lookup_ -- it will contact root DNS, then TLD DNS, then authoritative DNS)
- __Recursive query__ the contacted name server will do the resolution for you. (e.g. you contact the local DNS which will contact root DNS which will contact the TLD DNS which will contact the authoritative DNS -- _recursive at each step_)
	- puts burden on contacted server -- heavy load at upper levels of hierarchy
- DNS _caches_ at all levels, cached entries may be  _out of date_ until TTLs expire
- DNS resource records (RR) formatted as `name, value, type, ttl`
	- `type=A` -- `name` is hostname; `value` is IP address
	- `type=NS` -- `name` is domain (e.g. foo.com); `value` is hostname of authoritative NS of domain
	- `type=CNAME` -- `name` is alias for some 'canonical' (i.e. real) name; `value` is canonical name
	- `type=MX` -- `value` is name of mailserver associated with `name`
- DNS __query__ and __reply__ messages, both with the same format
	- ID, flags, # questions, # answers, # authority RRs, # additional RRs, questions[], answers[], authority[], additional[]
- DNS attack strategies include: DDOS attacks, redirect attacks (send person to a bogus website), exploiting DNS for DDOS (send queries with 'source' set to the targets IP)

###P2P (Peer-to-peer)
- with client-server architecture, the time to distribute a file to _N_ clients increases linearly with _N_
- with P2P each extra client brings extra _service capacity_, so the time to distribute a file between _N_ peers increases logarithmically with _N_
- __BitTorrent__
	- file is split into 256Kb chunks and peers exchange these chunks
	- a _tracker_ is used to keep a list of peers participating in the _torrent_
	- while downloading, chunks are sent _tit-for-tat_, meaning they will be sent first to the peers sending to you at the _highest rate_
	- peers can _optimistically unchoke_ peers, in the hope that they will each become in each others top providers
- __Distributed Hash Table (DHT)__ -- a distributed P2P database
	- stores `<key, value>` pairs
	- peers _query_ DHT with `key`
	- peers can also _insert_ `<key, value>` pairs
	- basically, `<key,value>`s will be stored on the peer that is __closest to the key__
		- computed by _hashing_ the key
	- _circular DHT_ where each peer only knows about its immediate successor and predecessor
		- takes on average _O(n)_ messages to resolve a query (where _n_ is number of peers)
		- can add _shortcuts_ across the circle such that queries take _O(log n)_
	- peers periodically ping neighbors to check aliveness, if immediate successor leaves, the next successor will be set as immediate successor
