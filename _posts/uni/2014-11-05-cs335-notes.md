##Spring framework
####IoC
- Interfaces improve extensibility and flexibility
- IoC allows component implementations and binding requirements to be manages separately from application code
- DI involved IoC container injecting dependencies into components through constructor/setter injection
- IoC containers offer service interfaces (eg. ApplicationContext) to interact with them

####AOP
- AOP allows more effective management of cross-cutting concerns
- Spring uses dynamic AOP where advice is woven at run time via proxies
- Spring allows several types of advice (@Before, @AfterReturning, @Around, @AfterThrowing, etc)
- pointcuts identify the precise joinpoint where the advice should be inserted
- Introductions allow objects to implement additional interfaces at runtime
- dynamic proxies contain invocation handlers that apply advice (basis of AOP proxies)

####RMI + Distributed Objects
- the aim of RMI is to hide the details of invoking a method over a server, so it is the same as a local method to the developer
- however it is necessarily different - parameters must be serialized, there is additional runtime overhead, remote calls can fail
- client invokes methods on local proxy objects
- serializes/marshals the object/arguments -> turns memory references into handles (class handle, object handle), and outputs as a byte stream

####Web Services
- HTTP is an open, stateless, request-reply standard
- SOAP (simple object access protocol)
	- uses XML
	- WSDL (web service description language) uses XML to describe the web service (service contract), includes datatypes, messages, operations etc
	- action-focused
- REST (representational state transfer)
	- resource-focused
	- relatively lightweight
- Spring allows abstraction above HTTP, achieving separation of concerns and reducing boilerplate code

####Data Access
- DAO (data access object) reads/writes the database
- DAO interfaces allow testability + modifiability
- Data sources can be:
	- pooled: many active connections, threads can request one to use
	- on demand: new connection created when needed
	- singleton: one connection, suitable for small applications
- Simple JDBC (w/ spring)
	- Uses tired and tested SQL. Direct manipulation of tables, rows, columns
	- Complexity grows with persistence requirements
- ORM (object relational mapping)
	- automates mapping between objects and SQL structures
	- automates SQL query generation
	- allows developers to focus on application logic in terms of objects

####Transactions
- Transactions deal with currency control problems
	- lost updates (`T:x.setBalance, U:x.setBalance`)
	- inconsistent retrieval (`T:x.withdraw, U:x.getBalance+y.getBalance, T:y.setBalance`)	
- by default each individual SQL statement is a transaction, we need the client to be able to specify the transaction start/end
- RMI clients use middleware API to specify  transaction boundaries on RMI calls.
- ACID
	- __A__tomicity: transaction either completes successfully, or fails with _NO_ effect
	- __C__onsistency: transaction takes system from one consistent state to another
	- __I__solation: one transaction cannot interfere with others
	- __D__urability: after successful transaction all effects are saved in permanent storage
- _Serially equivalent_ interleaving -- has the same effect when run concurrently or serially
	- all pairs of conflicting operations must be executed in the same order at all the objects they both access (read-write, write-read, write-write)
- aborting
	- _dirty reads_ -- U sees write of T before T aborts; fix by _cascading aborts_
	- _premature writes_ -- leads to inconsistent data where a transaction aborts; keep a 'before image' snapshot, delay write operations until other transactions commit/abort
- exclusive locks -- fixes all 4 problems but slow the DB
- _read/write locks_
	- read lock _sharing_: multiple transactions can hold a read lock on the same object
	- lock _promotion_: read lock can be promoted to write lock

| lock set 	| req read 	| req write |
| :------- 	| :------- 	| :-------- |
| none		| OK 		| OK		|
| read 		| OK 		| WAIT		|
| write 	| WAIT 		| WAIT		|

- deadlock:
	- prevent: 
		- acquire all locks _atomically_ (restrictive, may be unknown)
		- request in a predefined order (difficult)
	- timeout (simple)
	- detection and removal (find cycles in waiting-for graph)
- distributed transactions (over multiple servers) require a 2-phase commit, managed by a transaction manager
- spring allows us to specify transactions _declaratively_, spring will do all the hard work
	- `<tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager="txManager"/>`
	- `@Transactional public void updateXYZ() { ... }` 
- propogation =
	- `REQUIRED` -- must use a transaction, will use existing (if exists) [default]
	- `MANDATORY` will only use an existing; `REQUIRES_NEW`
	- `SUPPORTS` will use (if exists) or wont
	- `NOT_SUPPORTED`; `NEVER` (throws ex)
- isolation =
	- `READ_UNCOMMITTED` (breaks ACID isolation),
	- `READ_COMMITTED` (repeatable reads can occur i.e. val changes mid transaction due to other trans commit),
	- `REPEATABLE_READ` (fixes this, but phantom reads still possible i.e. see different rows if other trans added),
	- `SERIALIZABLE` (concurrent at cost of performance)
- `rollback-for <T> extends Exception`

####Security
- _symmetric encryption_: each party uses the _same_ key -- must be kept secret (not easy)
- DES (data encryption standard) uses 56-bit key -- far to easy to bruteforce
- AES (advanced encryption standard) 128-bit key
- public key _asymmetric encryption_, uses public-private key pairs
- __authentication__ methods
	1. unencrypted -- anyone can imitate anyone `Hi, I'm Alice`
	2. verify IP -- anyone can spoof `Hi, I'm 192.168.2.33`
	3. password with symmetric key -- anyone can record the encrypted message `Hi, I'm Alice {pw}K_ab`
	4. use a __nonce__ (one time number) A:`Hi, I'm Alice`, B:`nonce R`, A:`{R}K_ab` -- good, but we still need to keep that key "secret"
	5. public key cryptography
		- A: `Hi, I'm Alice`
		- B: `nonce R`
		- A: `{R}K_A-priv`	-- encrypt with your private key
		- B: `send me K_A-pub`	-- request for your public key
		- A: `K_A-pub`
		- leaves us open for a _man-in-the-middle_ attack
			- since B does not already know `K_A-pub`, M can pretend to be A (to B) and pretend to be B (to A)
- authentication systems are only as secure and the mechanisms for distributing keys!!
- message __integrity__
	- checksums are _insufficient_ for guaranteeing message integrity
	- _digital signature_ uses private key to encrypt the message
	- _message digest_
		- use _secure hash function_ (always gens a unique digest), private-key encrypt the digest and attach to the message
		- receiver will compute the digest (using same function), and compare it to your (public-key) decrypted digest
- _Certificates_
	- CA public keys are assumed to be well-known (maintained by OS, browser, etc)
	- built from `Entity ID + K_Entity-pub` signed by `K_CA-priv`
	- now instead of requesting `K_A-pub` we can request the _public key certificate_
- __SSL__
	- server sends _certificate_ to the client
	- client verifies `K_S-pub` (with `K_CA-pub` to decrypt signature)
	- client generates a _session key_ (symmetric crypto) and sends back `{K_session}K_S-pub`
	- now only the client and server know the session key and it will be used for all communication (during the session)

####Spring MVC
- dispatcher _servlet_ maps a request to a handler -> controller -> view resolver -> view
- annotation driven request mapping in controller class `@RequestMapping( ... ) public String foo()`
- view resolver turns request map `/contacts/list` into internal resource `/WEB-INF/views/contacts/list.jsp`
- JSP pages allow us to build HTML dynamically using data from the Model `JSP page + model data -> JSP processor -> HTML page`

##C# Functional Programming
####Intro
- C# `class` vs `struct`
	- class variables are __pointers__ to an object
	- struct variables are __objects__
- `out` parameters act as additional return values `void foo( ... , out int r) { ... }`
- __implicitly typed__ variable `var` (still a _static_ type)
- `dynamic` parameters can be any type (runtime checks) `void foo(dynamic x) { x.bar(); }`
- `dynamic` `ExpandoObject` can be dynamically expanded at runtime
- classes can be split into separate chunks/files `partial class Foo { ... }`
- we can create and initialize __anonymous types__ as `var foo = new { X="bar", Y="foobar" };` 
- we can make a variable nullable with the `?` operator `int? x = null;`
- the `??` operator will use val1 if not null else val2 `int? x = val1 ?? val2;`
- we define a __sequence__ as implementing `IEnumerable`
- `yeild return;` will return, then when the method is called again it will __resume__ from AFTER the `yeild return;` statement
- this allows us to create __virtual sequences__ (that use _lazy evaluation_) -- the "sequence" doesn't actually exist until we call the enumerator `MoveNext()` (e.g. implicitly in a `foreach` loop)
- also allows the creation of __infinite sequences__ `for (int n = 0; ; n++) { yeild return n*n; }`
- `IEnumerable<out T>` interface __covariant__ in T -- we can assign a list of type derived to a sequence of base variable e.g. `IEnumerable<MyBase> myBases = new List<MyDerived>();`
- `IComparar<in T>` interface __contravariant__ in T-- we can assign a base comparer to a derived comparer variable e.g. `IComparer<MyDerived> comp = new MyBaseComparer();`
- variance of generic delegates: (B=base, D=derived)

| pointer  | function | result |
| :------- | :------- | :----- |
| `B => B` | `B => D` | __covariance__ in _result_ type |
| `D => D` | `B => D` | __contravariance__ in _parameter_ type | 
| `D => B` | `B => D` | __contravariance__ in _parameter_ type and __covariance__ in _result_ type |
| `B => D` | `B => B` | _NOT_ safe |
| `B => D` | `D => D` | _NOT_ safe |
| `B => D` | `D => B` | _NOT_ safe |

- generic __constraints__ as `class FooList<T> where T : U`

####Data
- __SQL__ `"Data Source=foo.db.example.com;Integrated Security=True"`
	- access with _SQL queries_ or LINQ
	- _note_ SQL has __ternary logic__: true, false, _unknown_ (null) -- be aware when comparing
- __ODATA__ (REST-based web service) `http://example.com/api/fooService.svc/`
	- access with _ODATA URL queries_ (`... /fooService.svc/bar()?$top=3`) or LINQ
	- like REST, we can ask for different representations (XML, JSON, etc)
- see: [cs335-a2](//github.com/tehmantra/cs335-a2) for examples of how to use these
- __LINQ__ does not compile straight to CLR byte code, but instead stays as an _abstract syntax tree_ which can be magically assigned to a _provider_ at runtime (e.g. Byte code, SQL code, REST URL) depending on how it is evoked

####Functional programming
- __First-class__ and __higher order__ functions (aka __functionals__)
- ideally: functions should _only depend_ on _parameter_ values
- they should _not change_ the global state
- __Lambda expressions__ as anonymous inline functions
	- `Func<string, int> f = s => s.Length;`
		- f is a __delegate__ (pointer) to an anonymous function
		- which takes one string parameter, __s__
		- and returns __s.Length__
		- e.g. `f("hello");`
	- we can wrap this in an `Expression<Func<>>` which is a __tree structure__ representing the function -- similar to the compilers _intermediate tree structure_
	- expressions can have _multiple parameters_
		- e.g. `Func<int, int, int> f = (a, b) => a*b;`
	- they can also contain __free variables__, which are expected from the context
		- `int x = 5; Func<int, int> f = y => y + x;`
		- _note_ `x` is now part of the _closure_ of the function
	- can be __expressions__ i.e. `param => expr`
	- or __statements__ i.e. `param => { statements; }`
	- compiler uses _type inference_ to type the variables when they are not explicitly stated
	- functions returning _void_ are known as __actions__
- The __closure__ of a function is the function itself plus context __references__ for all its __free__ variables
	- closures are _hidden_, compiler-generated _closure objects_, where:
	- anonymous functions are __methods__,
	- free variables are transformed into __fields__
	- `class _Q { public int x; public _f(int y) { return y + x; } }` (_Q and _f are hidden compiler-generated names)
	- in c# closure objects are on the _heap_ so their lifetime is independent of the call stack -- helps us avoid the __funarg__ problem (java avoids this by requiring nested functions in anonymous inner classes be declared _final_)
- Functions can be __composed__ from other functions
	- given _f: A -> B_ and _g: B -> C_, construct _h: A -> C_ (_h: g o f_)
	- low level: `Func<T, T> h = x => g(f(x));`
	- high level: make _h_ a function that takes 2 functions (_f_ and _g_) as arguments, and returns their composition
		- `Func<A,C> H<A,B,C> (Func<A,B> f, Func<B,C>) { return x => g(f(x)); }`
- __Continuation passing style__ (CPS) uses ternary operator in lambda expression
	- `c(x)` returns a `bool`
	- `return x => c(x) ? f(x) : g(x);`
- __Currying__ transforms a function with _n_ parameters into a chain of _n_ functions with 1 parameter each -- potentially _faster_ execution due to _partial evaluation_ optimizations
	- `Func<int, int, int> p1 = (x, y) => x*x + y*y;`
	- `Func<int, Func<int, int>> p2 = x => (y => x*x + y*y);`
- __Memorization__ improve speed by caching function results in a _cache dictionary_

####Dynamic LINQ
- allows us to write LINQ queries using __string expressions__ which are dynamically parsed at runtime
- implemented as __extension methods__ for the `IQueryable` interface
- e.g.

| function | LINQ | Dynamic LINQ |
| :------- | :--- | :----------- |
| __Where__ | `v.Where(x => x.Length == 3);` | `v.AsQueryable().Where("Length == 3");` |
| __OrderBy ASC__ | `v.OrderBy(o => o.Price).ThenBy(o => o.OrderID);` | `v.AsQueryable().OrderBy("Price, OrderID");` |
| __OrderBy DESC__ | `v.OderBy(o => o.Price).ThenBy(o => o.OrderID);` | `v.AsQueryable().OrderBy("Price DESC, OrderID DESC");` |

- _note_: these result in the _same_ generated SQL
- how a method is called (i.e. on what object) will determine where it is executed
	- `Queryable.Where()` and `DynamicQueriable.Where()` are converted to SQL, `AsEnumerable.Where()` is done in memory (after bringing in _all_ data)
	- of course, all in memory sequences are processed in memory

####Common Functionals
- __Map__ applies a transformation, element-wise, to an input sequence and returns an output sequence. (aka select, apply, transform)
	- `static IEnumerable<U> Map<T,U> (this IEnumerable<T> seq, Func<T,U> f) { foreach (T x in seq) yield return f(x); }`
	- returns a _virtual sequence_, an example of _lazy evaluation_
	- _map fusion_ allows us to compose functions easily
		- `seq.Map(f).Map(g)` === `seq.Map(`_g o f_`)`
- __MapMany__ applies a transformation `T => IEnumerable<T>` to each element in a sequence. So it returns a sequence of sequences. (aka selectmany, collect)
	- universal MapMany concatenates the resulting sequences
	- `static IEnumerable<U> MapMany<T,U>(this IEnumerable<T> seq, Func<T,IEnumerable<U>> f) { ... }`
- __Fold__ iterates a given function over an input sequence and returns a __cumulated__ result (aka aggregate, accumulate, reduce)
	- uses an internal _accumulator_, with initial value _seed_
	- `static U Fold<T,U> (this IEnumerable<T> seq, U acc, Func<U,T,U> f) { foreach (T x in seq) acc = f(acc, x); return acc; }`
	- this is _not_ an iterator -- it runs over the while sequence before returning, and cannot be used on infinite sequences
- __Count__
	- `static int Count<T> (this IEnumerable<T> seq)  { return Fold(seq, 0, (a,v) => a + 1); }`
- __Take__ (aka top)
	- ... `if (count-- <= 0) break; yield return x;`...
- __Skip__ (aka tail)
	- ... `if (count-- <= 0) yield return x;` ...
- LINQ is built using these (and other) functionals
	- Sorting: _OrderBy, OrderByDescending, ThenBy, ThenByDescending, Reverse_
	- Set operators: _Distinct, Except, Intersect, Union_
	- Filtering: _Where, OfType_
	- Quantifiers: _All, Any, Contains_
	- Projections: _Select, SelectMany_
	- Partitioning: _Take, Skip, TakeWhile, SkipWhile_
	- Grouping: _GroupBy, ToLookup_
	- Other: _SequenceEqual, Single, First, Last, ElementAt, Zip_
- __Joins__
	- implementation based on __cross-join__ takes _N1 * N2_ steps
	- we could build a __lookup table__
		- building the table takes _N2_ steps, the __group-join__ then takes an additional _N1_ steps
		- _N1 + N2_ is _much_ faster than _N1 * N2_
	- we can then build an __inner-join__ based on the group-join (_N1 + N2 + M_)
		- however we can only join on the key equality (===); cross-join can join on any filter operator

####LINQ to SQL
- _SQL Bridge_: SQL data sources can be mapped to .NET `DataContext` (automatically generated by tools)
- `Queryable` methods _can_ generate SQL code -- `Enumerable` methods only generate bytecode
	- `AsQueryable()` and `AsEnumerable()` only _type cast_ -- no actual change, _but_ this does change the _method resolution_

####XPath
- uses a __functional path__-like notation for addressing parts of an XML document
- document _root node_ `/`
- _child operator_, an embedded `/`
- indexing via `[i]` (starts at 1 not 0)
- _wildcard_ `*`
- _recursive descent_ operator, including self `//`
- _prediactes_ appear inside `[]` and define __existential__ conditions (`!=` vs `not()`)
	- e.g. `/authors/author[nationality]` will select all authors who have _at least one_ nationality
	- `/authors/author[nationality!='Canadian']` will select authors who have _at least one_ nationality which is not Canadian
	- `/authors/author[not(nationality)]` will select authors who have _no_ nationality
	- `/authors/author[not(nationality='Canadian')]` will select those who do _not_ have the nationality Canadian
- _attributes_ `@`
- union `|`
- `XElement` contains _native_ methods that mimic XPATH operators
