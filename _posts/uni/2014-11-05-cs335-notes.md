####IoC
- Interfaces improve extensibility and flexibility
- IoC allows component implementations and binding requirements to be manages separately from application code
- DI involved IoC container injecting dependencies into components through constructor/setter injection
- IoC containers offer service interfaces (eg. ApplicationContext) to interact with them

####AOP
- AOP allows more effective management of cross-cutting concerns
- Spring uses dynamic AOP where advice is woven at run time via proxies
- Spring allows several types of advice (@Before, @AfterReturning, @Around, @AfterThrowing, etc)
- pointcuts identify the precise joinpoint where the advice should be inserted
- Introductions allow objects to implement additional interfaces at runtime
- dynamic proxies contain invocation handlers that apply advice (basis of AOP proxies)

####RMI + Distributed Objects
- the aim of RMI is to hide the details of invoking a method over a server, so it is the same as a local method to the developer
- however it is necessarily different - parameters must be serialized, there is additional runtime overhead, remote calls can fail
- client invokes methods on local proxy objects
- serializes/marshals the object/arguments -> turns memory references into handles (class handle, object handle), and outputs as a byte stream

####Web Services
- HTTP is an open, stateless, request-reply standard
- SOAP (simple object access protocol)
	- uses XML
	- WSDL (web service description language) uses XML to describe the web service (service contract), includes datatypes, messages, operations etc
	- action-focused
- REST (representational state transfer)
	- resource-focused
	- relatively lightweight
- Spring allows abstraction above HTTP, achieving separation of concerns and reducing boilerplate code


####Data Access
- DAO (data access object) reads/writes the database
- DAO interfaces allow testability + modifiability
- Data sources can be:
	- pooled: many active connections, threads can request one to use
	- on demand: new connection created when needed
	- singleton: one connection, suitable for small applications
- Simple JDBC (w/ spring)
	- Uses tired and tested SQL. Direct manipulation of tables, rows, columns
	- Complexity grows with persistence requirements
- ORM (object relational mapping)
	- automates mapping between objects and SQL structures
	- automates SQL query generation
	- allows developers to focus on application logic in terms of objects
