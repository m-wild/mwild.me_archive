##Logarithm rules
1.	log is the inverse exponential

	if $x = y^z$, then $log_y x = z$

2.	convert log bases by diving by the base you want
	
	$log_10 x = ln x / ln 10$

3.	Products turn into sums under log functions

	$log_y(AB) = log_y A + log_y B$

	<br>Ratios turn into differences

	$log_y(A/B) = log_y A - log_y B$
    
	<br>Exponents turn into factors

	$log_y(A^b) = b log_y A$



##Ratios and Decibels

For two __voltages__ $V_1$ and $V_2$
$r(dB) = 20 log_10(V_1/V_2)$

For two __powers__ $P_1$ and $P_2$
$r(dB) = 10 log_10(P_1/P_2)$

power ratio | dB
 :--- | :---
1:1	| 0
2:1 | 3
4:1 | 6
8:1 | 9
16:1 | 12
10:1 | 10
100:1 | 20
1000:1 | 30
10000:1 | 40 

ie. with $10^4$ the exponent is $4$ which gives $40dB$

__multiplying power ratios = adding dB__
$10:1 xx 10:1 = 100:1$
$10dB + 10dB = 20dB$


eg.
__what is $20:1$ power ratio in dB?__
break it up (with products)
$20 = 10xx2$
so we use the __sum__ of $10:1$ and $2:1$ in dB
$20:1 =	13dB$

and in reverse
__what is $44dB$ in power ratio?__
break it up (with sums)
$44 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 - 3 - 3$
addition of dB $->$ multiplication of power ratio
subtraction of dB $->$ division of power ratio
$100000 -: 4 = 25000$
$25000:1$

If we have a prime number ratio, __one we cant break up__ then remember:
Accuracy is important on the dB side, not so important on the power ratio side.
(So we can round the ratio side)
