##Electrical signals
- Electrical potential is _Voltage_ ($V$)
- Electrical flow is _Current_ -- measured in _Amps_ ($A$)
- To perform _work_ we need both current and voltage
- The amount of energy that can be transferred between systems per second is known as _Power_ and is measured in _Watts_ ($W$).
- Power is proportional to the square of the voltage.

####Types of cables
- Coax
	- inner copper conductor
	- plastic or foam insulator
	- copper mesh / tinfoil to lower signal radiation and interference
	- ratio of diameters $->$ impedance
	- diameter is important: larger diameter $->$ less signal loss over distance
- Twisted pair
	- each complementary pair is twisted to reduce signal radiation
- Optical fibre
	- cheap, glass or plastic
	- inner core, outer core, and insulation
	- outer core has a lower _refractive index_ than inner. this means light in the inner core is "trapped" by reflection/refraction
	- _multimode_ fibre sends more than one signal by using different angles of incidence
	- _wavelength multiplexing_ sends more signal by using different color light

####Wireless
- received signal power drops to a quarter when the distance doubles
- received signal voltage drops to a half when distance doubles (power is proportional to square of voltage)
- can typically live with received power that is $10^11$ times smaller than transmitted
- radio signals propagate with the speed of light $c$
- if the cycle time is $T$, then a radio wave travels the distance $lambda = cT$ in the time it completes one cycle.
- $lambda$ is called the _wavelength_
- $f = 1/T$ is called the _frequency_ of the signal

##Logarithm rules
1.	log is the inverse exponential

	if $x = y^z$, then $log_y x = z$

2.	convert log bases by diving by the base you want
	
	$log_10 x = ln x / ln 10$

3.	Products turn into sums under log functions

	$log_y(AB) = log_y A + log_y B$

	<br>Ratios turn into differences

	$log_y(A/B) = log_y A - log_y B$
    
	<br>Exponents turn into factors

	$log_y(A^b) = b log_y A$



##Ratios and Decibels
- For two __voltages__ $V_1$ and $V_2$
	- $r(dB) = 20 log_10(V_1/V_2)$
- For two __powers__ $P_1$ and $P_2$
	- $r(dB) = 10 log_10(P_1/P_2)$

power ratio | dB
 :--- | :---
1:1	| 0
2:1 | 3
4:1 | 6
8:1 | 9
16:1 | 12
10:1 | 10
100:1 | 20
1000:1 | 30
10000:1 | 40 

ie. with $10^4$ the exponent is $4$ which gives $40dB$

- __multiplying power ratios = adding dB__
	- $10:1 xx 10:1 = 100:1$
	- $10dB + 10dB = 20dB$


eg.
__what is $20:1$ power ratio in dB?__
break it up (with products)
$20 = 10xx2$
so we use the __sum__ of $10:1$ and $2:1$ in dB
$20:1 =	13dB$

and in reverse
__what is $44dB$ in power ratio?__
break it up (with sums)
$44 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 - 3 - 3$
addition of dB $->$ multiplication of power ratio
subtraction of dB $->$ division of power ratio
$100000 -: 4 = 25000$
$25000:1$

If we have a prime number ratio, __one we cant break up__ then remember:
Accuracy is important on the dB side, not so important on the power ratio side.
(So we can round the ratio side)

- We can use decibels to quote powers by comparing to 1 watt (dBW) or 1 milliwatt (dBm).
	- $30dBm = 30dB + 1mW = 1000xx1mW = 1W$
	- $-90dBW = -90dB + 1W = 10^-9 W$


##Satellite communication
- _Geostationary_ (or geosynchronous) satellites orbit on the equatorial plane at ~35,000km
	- They orbit the earth once every siderial day and thus appear to be in the same spot in the sky for 24hrs a day -- easy to point a dish antenna at
- _Low/Medium-Earth-Orbit_ (LEO/MEO) satellites orbit on some other plane and are much closer to the surface
	- they will cover more territory but will move out of sync with the earth and >1 is needed to maintain a link
	- the antenna on earth requires some movement to point to the satellite

##Types of communication channel
- _One-to-one_, __Simplex__ 
	- receiver doesn't communicate back to transmitter
	- e.g. TV remote control
- _One-to-one_, __Full-Duplex__ 
	- both parties can transmit and receive simultaneously
	- e.g. phone line
- _One-to-one_, __Half-duplex__
	- only one party can transmit at any one time
	- e.g. walkie-talkie radios
- _One-to-many_, Simplex __broadcast channel__
	- e.g. TV, radio
- _One-to-one_, __shared channel__
	- one party communicating with several others, one at a time
	- e.g. GSM cellphones
	- Special case: _wiretap channel_ (other party(s) listen in)
- __Many-to-many__, shared channel
	- participants act as both transmitters and receivers
	- easy to implement
	- only one transmitter can access the channel at a time
		- participants must negotiate channel access, manage collisions, or stick to a timing scheme
	- not every receiver may be able to hear every transmitter
	- e.g. CB radio, 802.11 WiFi
- Each channel has advantages and disadvantages and is suited to specific solutions
- Channel division methods
	- Lay separate cables or fibres
	- separate by mode or color (fibre)
	- separate by frequency (radio and electrical cable)
	- separate geographically (radio)
	- separate by polarization (radio)
	- separate by time slot (all media)

##Signals and information
- The __frequency__ is the number of oscillation cycles per second, measured in hertz ($Hz$)
- The __amplitude__ is the 'height' of the signal (voltage), typically measured in volts ($V$)
- The __power__ is always proportional to the square of a voltage, it's measured in watts ($W$)
- The __phase__ of a sine wave is a measure for how much the waveform is shifted to the left or right (i.e. along the time axis). It's and angle, so it's typically measured in degrees or radians

####Fourier transforms / series
- All signals can be looked at in two ways:
	- voltage over time
	- a mix of sinusoidal frequency signals, this is known as a _Fourier series_
- Fourier analysis shows us that to get a _square wave_ (as those used in a computer bit: 0 or 1) we would need an infinite number of sine functions with an infinitely high frequencies. This is not possible in reality.
- Transition time between bits limits the number of bits we can send per unit time.
	- The faster we can transition, the more bits we can send.
	- The more frequencies we can include, the more bits per second we can send.
- The __bandwidth__ of a communication channel is the difference between the highest and lowest frequency it can carry -- the __frequency band__ in which the communication takes place.
- bandwidth $~=$ (potential) bit rate
- if the lowest frequency in our band is 0 Hz, we call the signal in the band the _baseband signal_.
	- a simple bit stream with low/high voltage for 0/1 bits is always a baseband signal

####Power spectrum
- We can look at signal not just in the time domain (horizontal axis is time), but also in the _frequency domain_
	- In the frequency domain, the horizontal axis is power, i.e., the squares of amplitudes of the sinewaves in the signal
	- This is called the _power spectrum_ of the signal
- The difference between the highest and lowest (significant) frequency component in a signal's power spectrum represents the signal's bandwidth.
- In communications, the term bandwidth is used to describe both the width of the frequency band available for a signal and the width of a signal's actual power spectrum. (which we mean should be apparent from the context).

####Modulation
