## Best games I played not released in 2016

This category is surprisingly empty this year, I usually fill the early parts of the year with games from last year, and the middle with older games. But that didn't really happen this year. Maybe I was just too busy with work/projects? Maybe I've just played through all of last years games already?

### Bloodborne

I played through Bloodborne again in 2016, this time with an Arcane build. Played through the DLC and got the platinum. The DLC is fantastic and Bloodborne is probably my favourite Soul's game at this point.

### Virtue's Last Reward

The follow up to 999 continues the crazy story and brings some much needed quality-of-life improvements to the series.

### Diablo III: Reaper of Souls
Finally got round to playing Diablo III in 2016, and it's damn fun to play with friends. I still can't get fully on-board with loot driven games, but I've come to accept it. Don't worry about the purpose of the endgame -- just have fun with the game while it lasts.


## Best games I wish I finished in 2016

### Final Fantasy XV
<a href="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/ffxv.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/ffxv.min.jpg"></a>
Final Fantasy XV turned out better than it had any right to be. Playing Episode Duscae and The Platinum Demo gave me zero expectation that it would be any good -- Kingsglaive actually give me hope. 
Kingsglaive does an exceptional job at setting up the world and characters of FFXV and it should be required viewing before playing FFXV.
So far I'm really enjoying FFXV -- the mission design is great, the combat is so so much better than in the demos, and the story (while not as good as Kingsglaive) is doing enough to pull me along. I'm sure this will be a great game by the time I'm finished playing, and even better when Square finishes patching it.

### Zero Time Dilemma
More of what made 999 and VLR great, but this time with production values.


## Game of the Year 2016

### Uncharted 4: A Thief's End

Uncharted 4 is a technical masterpiece. It looks absolutely gorgeous on the PS4 and reminds you just how good a game can look when it's been crazy optimized for a console. Uncharted borrows more of the combat style from The Last of Us, but (unlike TLOU) throws tonnes of ammo at you so you can really go to town.

### Titanfall 2

This year's Halo stand-in. A very solid console shooter, the only downside is that there's not enough of it.

### World of Warcraft: Legion
<a href="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/wow.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/wow.min.jpg"></a>
WoW, after all these years, is still the king of MMOs -- and Legion is a great expansion. After preordering Warlords of Draenor and never once playing it, I thought I was done with WoW for good. Then I saw a preview for the Demon Hunter and it looked so good! (Also, all my friends were playing). This was the first time I got to experience end game raiding while the raids were new, and i really enjoyed the experience. It helped me to understand why the MMO endgame exists, why it's important, and why people keep playing and grinding.

### The Witness
<a href="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/witness.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/witness.min.jpg"></a>
This is this first game I've actually **needed** pencil and paper to finish. The puzzles get so cryptic that it's just impossible to solve them in your head.

### DOOM
<a href="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/doom.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://static.mwild.me/images/goty2016/doom.min.jpg"></a>
DOOM is structured so that you have to think, you have to read the map to know where you're going, you have to backtrack for upgrades and keys. It made me realise that I'd become lazy. I found myself wishing that I could just run forward and shoot without thinking -- and I hated it. Games are supposed to be challenging!! and I'm glad DOOM was there remind me.
