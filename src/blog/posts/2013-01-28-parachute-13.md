### Masses at Parachute 2013

After showing up late on Friday and missing sign ups for The Blackboard Sessions, we went along to see what amazing bands would be playing, only to find people covering the same Coldplay song twice. Chris and Mike snuck backstage and managed to smoothtalk their way into getting a set despite Blackboard Sessions already being behind schedule!

So with Dion's munted foot and none of our instruments, we rocked up and rocked out!

Thanks to everyone who saw us on the day!
