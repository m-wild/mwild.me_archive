# Hi I'm Michael. 

I'm a software engineer and drummer living in Auckland NZ. I love to build software that people love to use! 

I have worked for [The University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/), and I'm currently working for ~~CallPlus~~ ~~M2Group~~ [Vocus Group NZ](http://www.vocus.co.nz/).

<br>
You can find some of my work at **[github.com/tehmantra](https://github.com/tehmantra)**.
