I feel like 2016 has been a pretty rough year for album releases -- I only really got deep into a couple of records. But that doesn't mean it's all bad, I was just spending most of my time listening to albums from 2015. Namely: Intronaut - The Direction of Last Things, which I ranked 7th last year, has easily moved up to the number 2-3 spot.

1.  Katatonia - The Fall of Hearts
    
    Easy #1 this year, Katatonia return with the first full-length record since 2012's Dead End Kings.
    If you like Katatonia's style, this is more of the same and it's solid as ever. A bit less "metal" than before, but still just as heavy.

2.  Norma Jean - Polar Similar

    Listen: [Everyone Talking Over Everyone Else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh54uKPHco)

3.  Hellions - Opera Oblivia
    
    If you like that nu-metal sound, mixed with some hardcore, mixed with a little bit of prog, alt, and everything else -- this is the record for you.

    Listen: [Bad Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pNkBKAxzHs)

4.  Syd Arthur - Apricity
5.  BABYMETAL - METAL RESISTANCE
6.  Motopsycho - Here Be Monsters
7.  Mothra - Decision Process
8.  Twelve Foot Ninja - Outlier
9.  Storm The Sky - Sin Will Find You
10. The Dear Hunter - Act V: Hymns with the Devil in Confessional
